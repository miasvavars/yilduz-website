	 <strong>Justification for Yilduz website</strong> 
	  <br> <br>
Before designing the prototype for our website we examined the brand roadmap and made sure all the design elements that make Yilduz unique are present in our website. Yilduz core values are comfort, positive outlook, growth and open mindedness and we wanted our website to represent those values.

The team chose different kinds of blue colors since this colour blue stands for stability, peace and calmness. Blue color is said to be trustworthy and relaxing, just like quality and safety are related to the color (Ferriera, 2019). As mentioned above, Yilduz is all about comfort and reducing stress, therefore the blue colors were chosen for the website. 
		  
		 <ul class="colornames"><li>#fffff White</li>
			 <li>#00000 Black</li>
			 <li>#9ED6E5 Regent St Blue</li>
			 <li>#C4E6F2 Mint Tulip</li>
			 <li>#286484 Calypso</li>
			 <li>#81C0EA Seagull blue</li>
		  </ul>
	  <img src="images/colourcodes.JPG" class="image1 img-fluid" alt="colourcodes"/>
	  <br>
	  For the website we picked out a neutral yet readable and professional font. Yilduz wants the customers to find the website easy to read and to give them the feeling of calmness. We do not want the customer to struggle with reading our content. 
	  
	  <ul class="colornames"><li>LATO BOLD CAPS– 16 points - Used for titles</li>
			 <li>LATO REGULAR CAPS – 11 points - Used For Subtitles</li>
			 <li>LatoRegularlowercase – 11 points - Used for body text</li>
	  </ul>
	  The style of the website was designed to be easy to navigate around in and we do make use of too many visuals. We wanted to have a clear structure so all of our services and content is easy to find. The reason why we did not use too many visuals is because Yilduz is focusing more on tips and methods to reduce stress that our website provides. 

When entering the websites visitors first find the homepage, where the brand and website are introduced. We wanted to provide our visitors the main focus in just one eyesight. From the home page you can navigate through all the pages on Yilduz including about us, Yilduz news and our services and all pages have the same footer.

		  <strong> User testing round #1 </strong> (Adobe XD prototype) 
		  <br><br>		  
		  Testing plan: <br><br>
<strong>Research question:</strong> What can we improve to make our website more user friendly to our future consumers?
		 <br>
		 <br>
		  <strong> Purpose of our test:</strong>
Define possible problems, improvements, test the usability of our app. We will address the purpose of our app by letting our users experience the prototype.
		  <br><br>
 <strong>Methods and scenario:</strong>
We will tell our participants about the main focus of our platform, its products and services. We will also provide participants with the information that a free guide will be available. The scenario we will tell our participants is the following: “You are busy handing in an assignment you worked days on, it's 3 hours before the deadline. When you’re handing it in CumLaude suddenly jams and your laptop looks completely dead, you're so stressed that you can’t think clearly, you decide to reach out for help to get your stress levels down.”
		  <br>
<strong>Requirement strategy:</strong>
We tested the app at a sample size of one test subject. To stay as close to our target audience as possible we searched for test subjects in school, so they are likely to have experienced stress.
		  <br> <br>
 
<strong>Goal:</strong>
Go from the home page to the Yilduz news page, read an article. After that go to the service page and add service two to the chart. 
		  <br>
		  <br>
After they tried our prototype, we follow up with these questions:
		  </div>
		<ul class="colornames">  
<li>Do you think this website would work for you?</li>
<li>Why would this (not) work for you? </li>
<li>Did you understand every step of the testing process? </li>
<li>Do you have any improvements? </li>
		  </ul>
		<br>
		  <div class="card">
		  <div class="card-bodytwo">
<strong>Support used:</strong>
We created a digital prototype in Adobe XD and met with our participants on campus. The recordings of our testing can be found in the appendix.
		  <br><br>
<strong>Usability report</strong>
Plan: we planned out that every user would take about two minutes to reach the goal. In practice, we found out that it took the participants more time. During the testing we found out our app still needs to have a lot of work perfecting it. Not only the layout and graphic features. But also, some technical changes. 
		  <br><br>
We can conclude that every test subject could interact with the app and eventually everyone succeeded to finish the goal. Out of observation and the answers to the questions we asked we came up with the following findings:

		  <ul class="colornames">
<li>Create an option to add multiple services (products) at the same time.</li>
<li>Make the app more practical and clearer for the eye.</li>
<li>Make the ‘add to chart’ function more visible.</li> 
<li>Make the design more coherent.</li> 
<li>From news to services needs to be connected properly. </li>
